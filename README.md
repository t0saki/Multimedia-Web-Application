This is a web application that introduces a province/city in China using interactive media. The purpose of the website is to attract tourists, investors, and professionals to visit, do business, and work there. The website promotes and advertises the scenery, resources, culture, and prospects of the place.

### Video Demo

## Target Audience

The website is designed for the general public, including children, adults, and the elderly.

## Features

The website is highly interactive and dynamic, with a clear and well-defined purpose. It has a clear structure and screen layout, and delivers high user experience. The website is compatible with all browsers and screen sizes. Creative design and visual impact have been taken into consideration to enhance appeal.

## Hypothetical Scenario

If this project were funded by the local government, we would prioritize highlighting the unique selling points of the province/city and making it stand out among other destinations. We would research and showcase the best tourist attractions, business opportunities, and career prospects, while also providing practical information such as transportation and accommodations. We would use multimedia elements such as videos, photos, and interactive maps to engage and inform visitors. We would also ensure that the website is accessible and user-friendly for all audiences.
